<h2>Summer Brilliance</h2>

<p>In the blaze of a bright summer noon,<br>
    where spring whispers its final tune,<br>
    there dances a vision in white,<br>
    a woman whose beauty ignites the light.</p>

<p>Her smile, a balm to my solitude,<br>
    warms the chill of my quietude.<br>
    Yet deepens the ache for her embrace,<br>
    a longing born from a distant space.</p>

<p>Never have words passed between,<br>
    only dreams from afar have been seen.<br>
    She haunts me with a ghostly grace,<br>
    her absence a void no one can replace.</p>

<p>Oh, to speak and find her less,<br>
    to break the spell of her finesse.<br>
    Or to hear her voice, a soothing balm,<br>
    where limerence blossoms into calm.</p>

<p>May her melody turn my despair<br>
    into a love beyond compare.<br>
    In her gaze, may I find my haven,<br>
    and life turn, at last, to heaven.</p>
