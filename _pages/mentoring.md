In general, please reach out if you have questions about my research, UW or UWNLP, getting a masters or PhD in NLP, or industry work. Happy to help in any way that I can!

If you are applying to grad school, I'd recommend checking out my blog post on [writing a good personal statement](https://suchin.io/personal-statement-advice/).

## Undergrads and Masters Students

Getting research experience is the best way to figure out whether you'd like to pursue a PhD. Research experience is also required for getting into most PhD programs these days.

I've collaborated with many [awesome](##Undergrad/Masters-Collaborators) undergrads and masters students.

If you're looking to work on a project, please email me a brief overview of your general research interests, as well as your resume. I mostly care about whether our research interests align, your previous experience, as well as your short-term career goals. Most of the projects I work on have a heavy programming component, so it's necessary that you have worked on previous projects with Python (especially [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and associated libraries, e.g. [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)) before. If you can point to personal or class projects, or published work, that demonstrate your experience, that would be great.

If you don't have such experience yet, there are [lots](https://huggingface.co/) of [great](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) [online](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class) [resources](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) to get up and running, as well as [NLP classes](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse517/) at UW that you could take.
