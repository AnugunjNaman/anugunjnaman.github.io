I'm a software engineer at [Legato Health Technologies](https://www.legato.com)working with Responsible AI Team on fairness, explainability and data drift for classification and regression models for tabular and text data. I'm broadly interested in developing computationally efficent and trustworthy machine learning models for variety of applications.

Previously, I was an intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) under the supervision of [Kumari Deepshikha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepkshikha/) where I worked on class-imbalance problem for images and speech-to-text conversion for Indic Languages. I was also an intern at [AI-ML-NLP Lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) where I worked on author profiling of tweets under the supervision of [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/).

I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/) in 2022.

I have also contributed to open-source at [HuggingFace ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/) I have added Microsoft's [CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/cvt) and [LeViT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/levit).

Feel free to look at my [CV](https://anaman.io/assests/NamanCV.pdf)!
